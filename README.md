- 👋 Hi, I’m @indrek4
- 👀 I’m interested in reverting App named ClipGrab
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to get back ability to download Reels (as *.mp4) from Facebook. I had it before but FB or ClipGrab changed something and for now the ClipGrab can't find the files on the website.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on getting back ability to download Reels
- 📫 How to reach me - I don't know - could sb write here somewere about it?

- ⚡ Fun fact: it worked yet week ago. Now I get each time a message: No downloadable video could be found. Maybe you have entered the wrong link or there is a problem with your connection.
